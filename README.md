# Practice Problems

To familiarize FRC 5806 programmers with robotics programming we've drafted this sheet of problems relating to robot control.  These questions begin general and simple, and evolve to become specific and complex.  On later questions it may be helpful to work with a group.  Additionally, try to see if certain problems are more your niche then others; you may find that you're best suited towards data structures, sensor processing, or computer vision.
