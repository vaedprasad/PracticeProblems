# PracticeProblems

## General Problems

### Decimal to Binary

Write a program that accepts a base ten (non-fractional) number at the command line and outputs the binary representation of that number

### Integer to English

Write a program that takes an integer and displays the English name of that value.

You should support both positive and negative numbers, in the range supported by a 32-bit integer (approximately -2 billion to 2 billion).

### Recursive Factorial

Write a function that correctly computes the factorial of a number recursively. 

## Object Oriented Problems

### Shape

Define a Shape object, where the object is any two dimensional figure, and has the following characteristics: a name, a perimeter, and a surface area.

### Circle

Define a subclass of your Shape class and call it Circle. It should retain and accurately output the values of the aforementioned characteristics of a Shape.

### Triangle

Define a subclass of your Shape class and call it Triangle. This time, the name of the triangle should take into account if it is equilateral (all 3 sides are the same length), isoceles (only 2 sides are the same length), or scalene (no 2 sides are the same).

## C++ Problems

### Reverse linked list

Write a function that takes in a `forward_list` and prints its contents from back to front.

### Sorting a linked list

Write a function that sorts a `list` of doubles and returns it.
