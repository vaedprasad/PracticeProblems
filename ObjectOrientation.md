## Object Oriented Problems

### Shape

Define a Shape object, where the object is any two dimensional figure, and has the following characteristics: a name, a perimeter, and a surface area.

### Circle

Define a subclass of your Shape class and call it Circle. It should retain and accurately output the values of the aforementioned characteristics of a Shape.

### Triangle

Define a subclass of your Shape class and call it Triangle. This time, the name of the triangle should take into account if it is equilateral (all 3 sides are the same length), isoceles (only 2 sides are the same length), or scalene (no 2 sides are the same).
