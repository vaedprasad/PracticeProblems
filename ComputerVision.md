## Computer Vision Problems

### Tracking a ball

Write a program using OpenCV that tracks the position of a ball in 2D space.  If you're feeling adventurous, try doing it in 3D space.  If you're feeling super duper adventurous, try tracking two identical balls at the same time while keeping track of which is which.

### Shape identification

Write a program that can identify the shape and color of regular polygons from a webcam feed, and track them in 2D space.

### Object Learning

Write a program that can take a picture of an object, have a user select the object from the picture and track the object in 2D space from a continuous webcam input.
